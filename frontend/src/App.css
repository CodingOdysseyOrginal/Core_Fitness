/* Things to fix
1. fix border while scrolling on navbar as it leaks over
2. adjust colors and make font stay out more (maybe look into good fonts that are thick)
3. double check sidebar for navbar to make sure it works correctly with any adjustments
4. finally adjust colors to match syle of website site. look into navyblue maybe (also see about changing gorillas to white on navbar when you scroll. not sure if possible but worth a shot) */
